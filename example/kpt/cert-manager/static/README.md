This directory contains a deployable representation of this example cert-manager kpt package.
It contains the static manifest `generated-manifest.yaml` that is generated by a kpt function as well as an `inventory-template.yaml` that is manually created once using `kpt live init .` and identifies the component within the cluster in order or prune resources during an upgrade (`kpt live apply .`) and to be able to uninstall it (`kpt live destroy .`).
