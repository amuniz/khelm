This directory contains a deployable representation of the kpt package.
It contains the static manifest `generated-manifest.yaml` that is generated by a kpt function as well as a manually created `Namespace` and `inventory-template.yaml`.
The `inventory-template` is created once using `kpt live init .` and identifies the component within the cluster in order or prune resources during an upgrade (`kpt live apply .`) and to be able to uninstall it (`kpt live destroy .`).  

Though please note that, to use the example in practice, you'd need to add the cert-manager CRDs as well.
